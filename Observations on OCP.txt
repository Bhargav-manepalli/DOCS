ocp-diag-quickstart :

This repository contains sample codebases that produce OCP Test & Validation output. They are intended to be used as a base to write new compliant diagnostics.

- explored whether we can implement something or not.

Left because we didn't found any implementation ideas on this.

ocp-diag-python : 

The OCP Test & Validation Initiative is a collaboration between datacenter hyperscalers having the goal of standardizing aspects of the hardware validation/diagnosis space, along with providing necessary tooling to enable both diagnostic developers and executors to leverage these interfaces.

Specifically, the ocp-diag-python project makes it easy for developers to use the OCP Test & Validation specification artifacts by presenting a pure-python api that can be used to output spec compliant JSON messages.

- explored whether we can implement something or not.

Use Cases of Open Network Linux (ONL):
Bare-Metal Switch Management:

ONL is designed for managing and running network operating systems on bare-metal switches. It is useful in data centers where hardware from multiple vendors is used.
Network Automation and Customization:

ONL allows for automating network configurations, making it suitable for large-scale deployments and custom networking setups.
Open Compute Project (OCP) Hardware:

If your hardware is based on OCP, ONL can provide an optimized operating system for managing networking equipment.

- Left it because , we didn't have any OCP hardware. 
- Software related things we didn't found any other info to move further on this.
